### Automations

- [Automatically uploading the daily NYT crossword to a Supernote](https://nathanbuchar.com/automatically-uploading-the-nyt-crossword-supernote/) ([GitHub Actions version](https://github.com/arichiv/supernote-crossword))

### Chauvet

Chauvet is the name of the operating system of Supernote. It is possible for you to [join their beta program](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/mwm3bx/early_testers_program_apply_for_early_testing_of/), to test new features before they are releases to everyone. Be careful though, it may break things.

### Howtos

- [Synchronize two Supernote devices together](https://youtu.be/-nrZUQiIqY4)

### Icons

This section contains `.note` files with drawing and icons you can easily select, copy and paste in your own notes. To use them, you need to download the `.note` file, and add it to your `Note` folder with the cloud you use for syncing your device. You won't be able to send most of them by email because of the file size.
